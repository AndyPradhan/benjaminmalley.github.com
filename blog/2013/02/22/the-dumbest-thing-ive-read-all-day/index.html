<div class="entry-content"><p>I was just beginning to like The Verge and then <em>bam!</em> they published
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/22/4016582/after-so-many-hacks-why-wont-java-just-go-away">this
article</a>
in which the author fails to differentiate between Java <em>applets</em>, which
were always a terrible idea and the JVM, which continues to be an
awesome piece of kit and arrives at the completely erroneous conclusion
that Java needs to die.</p>

<p>First, let&#8217;s separate Java the language from Java the platform. Without Java the platform, we wouldn&#8217;t have Clojure,
Scala or the Android SDK (the author admits as much). I don&#8217;t think
there&#8217;s anyone out there in the world advocating we get rid of those, so
that clearly needs to stay.</p>

<p>This leaves us with Java the language for which there&#8217;s a lot of hate
out in the wild. Some of this, clearly, is deserved. Java&#8217;s list of
features is short. Type erasure was a mistake. Null pointer exceptions
were probably a mistake. Changes to the language are slow to be
implemented and there&#8217;s a growing sense that it&#8217;s just not catching up
fast enough.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing some Android programming lately and one of the very
first things I did was scout around for ways to do it in anything but
Java. There are a few options, but I decided that since what I would be
spending most of my time with was interacting with the SDK class, I bit the bullet and dug in with Java. And in so
doing, I found a kind of beauty. The language is minimal enough that I
almost never have to think about <em>how</em> to accomplish something. In Java,
there&#8217;s usually a single best way to accomplish a particular goal and
it&#8217;s usually straightforward (although, yes, pity the cases when it is).
Others can look at my code and understand at a glance what I am doing.</p>

<p>There are those out there who would say that Scala &#8220;replaces&#8221; Java.
Wikipedia says it was designed to be a &#8220;better&#8221; Java.  Looking at its
feature set, I can understand why one would think it has succeeded. But,
seriously, look
at it: Scala is a huge hulking mess! It looks and feels exactly like a
language that is designed to be all things to all people.
Semi-colons are optional. The return keyword is optional. Methods can be
called infix style.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think Scala is bad.</p>

<p>Scala supporters claim that their language fixes some of Java&#8217;s flaws.
Wikipedia asserts that it was designed to be a &#8220;better Java.&#8221; Looking at
the list of features, it ticks every box I could ever want for Java:
value-oriented programming, expression-oriented programming, immutable
collections, mixins, good concurrency support, even algebraic data types
are in there! It&#8217;s a damn good list and if I chose programming languages
exclusively based on those lists, I&#8217;d pick Scala over Java any day of
the week.</p>

<p>Sometimes I am, in fact, tempted to pick Scala. But every time I am,
there&#8217;s one thing that holds me back: the language is a complete mess. I
see Scala as something like the anti-Lisp. There&#8217;s so much syntax needed
to support the many paradigms Semi-colons are optional. The return
keyword is optional. For every problem there are sixteen or seventeen
ways to approach it. I program in Haskell a lot, so I know how this
feels.</p>
