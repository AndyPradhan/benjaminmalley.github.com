Formal classroom feedback mechanisms often give students the opportunity to provide professors with feedback only after the end of class. Our team of five wanted to shorten this feedback cycle and increase student engagement with class.  We sought to understand the issues with current feedback mechanisms by surveying students and faculty and analyzing the results. We found that with existing systems, students often are not motivated to provide quality feedback and may not recall important concerns they had while participating in the course.

We used personas and scenarios and prototyping to design Feedback Channels, a web application that allows students to give feedback and ask questions during a lecture with interrupting class.  Feedback Channels allows students to rate the course during class as often as they want as well as ask questions and provide comments. It uses this data to provide teachers with a real time indication of student engagement and understanding as well as a list of ongoing student questions and concerns.  This way, teachers can address student issues seamlessly, without needing to interrupt the class or wait for formal feedback.

A beta version of the application has been used in courses at the University of Michigan. Take a look at the project site <a href="http://www.bblis.com/">here</a>.
