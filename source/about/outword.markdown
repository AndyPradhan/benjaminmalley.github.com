As part of a team of four, I developed outWord, an innovative location-based word game for the iPhone. outWord displays available letters on a map interface and uses a player's location to determine what letters are available to him or her. Thus, players may need to travel to another location, be it by foot, bike or skateboard to complete a word. Players compete with others nearby to maximize their score radius, the geographic area in which a player has the highest score, as well as to get on outWord's leaderboard.

Our team won a highly competive start up competition funded by RPM Ventures and was one of the founding members of the TechArb, a student start-up incubator that provides a collaborative environment for a number of newly minted entrepreneurs at the University of Michigan. TechArb, along with RPM Ventures, successfully lobbied (both directly and through our achievements) the University's Center for Entrepreneurship to assume support of the incubator.

One of our goals for outWord was to use social gaming as a way to encourage outdoor activity. We conducted user research with active players of outWord in the Ann Arbor area and found that players were motivated to explore the city for letters.

Our motivation and process are described in Encouraging Walking with a Social Game.
