I analyzed bid data from Swoopo.com, a now-defunct penny auction site, to investigate the company's claim that their automated bidding system helped players win auctions. I found that while players who used the site's automated bidding system won auctions with more frequency than those who did not, they paid a significantly higher price on the items they won.

I also investigated a model for identifying possible collusions in auctions by comparing the distribution of participant bid counts (number of bids per participant) against similar auctions (determined by comparing the item up for bid).  I found a that a small number of auctions had highly skewed distributions compared to similar auctions, indicating a possible collusion.

I was not in any way affiliated with nor responsible for the demise of Swoopo.com
