Inappropriate use of radiological studies (inappropriate imaging) is a noted problem in today's health care landscape that causes increased spending and increased patient risk without any corresponding increase in population-level health outcomes.

Although many of the technological hurdles to reducing inappropriate imaging have been in place for a number of years, they are not well integrated with existing primary care physician workflows and, as such, are not widely adopted outside of the hospital setting.

To solve this problem, in 2012 I led the development of a proposal to reduce inappropriate imaging in a primary care setting through patient education, clinical decision support and health information exchange. In July of 2012, Altarum was awarded an <a href=”http://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/Health-Care-Innovation-Awards/Michigan.html”>$8 million innovation grant</a> from CMS to carry out this program over a three year period.

As part of this grant, we are building a clinical decision support system and information exchange which is better integrated with the physician workflow. I am directly responsible for user research, prototyping and front development of the clinical decision support system.

To fully understand the needs and motivations of our system's potential users, I conducted interviews and observation sessions with physicians, nurses and medical assistants in Michigan, identified key themes and developed personas and scenarios. With that research, I began developing prototypes which we showed to physicians to gauge their effectiveness.

One notable problem with clinical decision support systems is the difficulty of specifying a patient's clinical scenario in a way that is accessible by both the physician and the decision support algorithm. Most clinical decision support systems address this problem by having physicians select one or more options from long forms. In the research phase, we discovered that this model was both overwhelming to the physicians and led to inaccuracies the clinical scenario. To address this problem, we leveraged faceted navigation, which allows users to easily search, filter and sort the data elements, giving multiple paths for physicians to quickly arrive at the correct clinical scenario. To assess the effectiveness of this interface, I created and tested several iterations of interactive prototypes developed with Angular JS.
