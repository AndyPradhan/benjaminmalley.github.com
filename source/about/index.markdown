I am a software developer and user researcher which broadly means that I believe
users are more important than monads. I am particularly interested in
information visualization and solving UX problems in health care. On the
tech side, I do Python (Django, Flask) and JS (d3, Angular) and I have a
deep fondness for Haskell. I don't mind being paid in pizza.
