I am a **software developer** and **user researcher** which broadly means that I believe
users are more important than monads. I am particularly interested in
information visualization and solving UX problems in health care. On the
tech side, I do Python (Django, Flask) and JS (d3, Angular) and I have a
deep fondness for Haskell. I don't mind being paid in pizza.

I am currently an analyst and consultant at Altarum in Ann Arbor, MI where I **advise clients** on the workflow impact, user experience and population-level health outcomes of health information systems and **build new systems** to address these needs. I am looking to relocate to Portland, OR in 2013.

Take a look at some of my current and previous projects below.
