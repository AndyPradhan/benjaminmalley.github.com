I was just beginning to like The Verge and then *bam!* they published
[this article](http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/22/4016582/after-so-many-hacks-why-wont-java-just-go-away) in which the author conflates Java *applets*, which were always a terrible idea, with the entire Java ecosystem, which continues to be an awesome piece of kit and arrives at the completely erroneous conclusion that Java needs to die. Honestly, I'm getting tired of all the Java hate. 

We need Java. None of its purported "successor languages" do the "C++
without guns knives or clubs" thing better than Java. Scala? Great language,
but have you seen it? Do we really think the next Java needs infix style
method invocation? And even if for whatever reason Java the *language*
tomorrow is scrapped tomorrow, we still need Java the *platform*.
Clojure needs it, Scala needs it, Android needs it (yes, I know Android
runs on Dalvik, but most Android *development* happens on the JVM). The
JVM is fast. Really fast. It runs on pretty much every platform you can
think of. So at the end of the day, if we kill "Java", we haven't done
anything to mitigate the security problems The Verge is so worried
about.

So by all means, kill the applets. Purge Java from laptops.  Relegate
it to the servers, where it belongs. Make it sit in the corner and wear
a funny hat. But please, put down the pitchforks.
